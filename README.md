# Smart City Management System

## Project Description

The Smart City Management System is a computer-based solution designed to assist both students and employees in accessing relevant information about scholarships and job opportunities, respectively. The system utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented with Java Swing. The data for students and employees is stored in CSV files.

## Features

### For Students

- **Scholarship Information:**
  - Students can access information about all available scholarships.
  - Scholarship recommendations are provided based on their GPA.
  
- **Data Storage:**
  - All student data is stored in a CSV file for easy retrieval and management.

### For Employees

- **Job Opportunities:**
  - Employees can explore available job opportunities.
  - Job recommendations are provided based on their years of experience.

- **Data Storage:**
  - Employee data is stored in a CSV file for efficient tracking and organization.

## GUI Used

The graphical user interface for the Smart City Management System is implemented using Java Swing. This provides a user-friendly experience for both students and employees.

## Problems Faced

Working on this project posed challenges, especially in the areas of GUI implementation and file handling. The team encountered the following difficulties:

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - Learning and implementing Java Swing for the first time.
   - Overcoming challenges related to layout design and responsiveness.

2. **File Handling:**
   - Dealing with file operations, such as reading from and writing to CSV files.
   - Managing and organizing data effectively for both students and employees.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced GUI:**
  - Implement a more polished and visually appealing user interface.
  - Incorporate additional features for ease of use.

- **Data Security:**
  - Implement secure data storage practices to protect sensitive information.

- **Integration:**
  - Explore opportunities to integrate with external databases for more dynamic data handling.
